# AWS Infrastructure with Terraform (Hands-On Labs)

This repository contains hands-on Terraform labs where I provisioned and managed AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code.

These labs demonstrate real practical experience with Terraform, AWS services, remote state management, variables, and provisioning.

## What I Built

### 🔹 Providers
Configured AWS provider and Terraform initialization.

### 🔹 IAM User
Created IAM users and attached policies using Terraform.

### 🔹 S3 Bucket
Provisioned S3 buckets with Terraform configuration.

### 🔹 DynamoDB
Created DynamoDB tables for state locking and data storage.

### 🔹 EC2 Provisioners
Launched EC2 instances and used provisioners.

### 🔹 Variables
Used input variables and outputs for reusable infrastructure code.

### 🔹 Remote State
Configured remote backend using S3 and DynamoDB for state management.

### 🔹 HCL Basics
Practiced core Terraform syntax and structure.
